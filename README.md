********PORTFOLIO VALUATION BASED ON THE COFFEE CONSUMPTION *************

In today's fast-paced world, integrating diverse datasets and predictive modeling to forecast financial outcomes is increasingly significant. This project explores the financial potential of everyday coffee consumption by analyzing how money spent on coffee could be strategically invested in assets like stocks and bonds. By merging consumer behavior insights with financial strategies and machine learning, we aim to optimize portfolio value based on daily coffee expenditures. This multidisciplinary approach highlights the often-overlooked economic impact of routine spending and its potential for enhancing personal wealth accumulation through data-driven financial decisions.

The index.html file is located in the templates folder, which serves as user interface for the application.

The app.py file contains the code for the Flask web application, which connect the UI with the backend logic

The model.ipynb includes the exploratory data analysis and the development of the machine learning model.

Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:
-Python 3.x
-Flask (for the web application)
-Jupyter Notebook (for model development and EDA)



Usage Instruction

a).Set Up the Environment

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Navigate to the project directory.


b).Run the Web Application

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the Flask application using the following command:
3. Run the following command in the bash, 'python app.py'
4. The application will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this address in your web browser to access the UI.

c).Understanding the Jupyter Notebook

-The model.ipynb file contains all the steps for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
-Open this file in Jupyter Notebook to view and run the code. It will provide insights into how the model was built and can be modified or retrained as needed.

d). Interacting with the application
-Once the Flask server is running, you can interact with the UI through the index.html page. This page might include forms for input, buttons to submit data, and areas where results or predictions are displayed.
